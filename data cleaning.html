<h4>Preprocessing</h4>

<p>All datasets has gone through a cleaning process. The database data are similar in terms of attribute content, so the cleaning process described will be applicable for all of them.  
</p>


<h3>Database data</h3>
<p>
These data contains 76 variables. According to published material [(x)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease), [(y)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0002914989905249) and the UCI repository only a subset of 14 variables is used. In this analysis there is chosen 9 variables:   
</p>

<img src="github_screenshot.png" style="float:right; width:40%">

<ul style="list-style-type:number">
<li><b>id</b> Subject identification number </li>
<li><b>age</b> Age in years </li>
<li><b>sex</b> Sex of subject (1 = female, 2 = male) </li>
<li><b>cp</b> Chest pain type </li>
  <ul style="list-style-type:number">
  <li> Typical angina </li>
  <li> Atypical angina </li>
  <li> Non-anginal pain </li>
  <li> Asymptomatic </li>
  </ul>
<li><b>trestbps</b> Resting blood pressure in mmHg </li>    
<li><b>chol</b> Serum cholesterol in mg/dl </li>
<li><b>smoke</b> Smoking history (1 = true, 0 = false) </li>
<li><b>fbs</b> Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true, 0 = false) </li>
<li><b>cvdPresent</b> Diagnosis of heart disease (1 = true, 0 = false) </li>
</ul>

<p>
These variables are chosen based on publications and current research of heart disease risk factors (see <b>About CVD</b>).  
</p>


<h3>Cleaning steps</h3>

<p>
The cleaning steps are performed in RStudio. First data is loaded and converted to a tibble data frame. All 76 columns are renamed with their respectively name stated in the databases. The data sets are reduced to contain only the stated 9 variables as above.   
</p>

</div>



<p>The *sex* variable is transformed from binary to contain 1 and 2 being female and male respectively. This is for easier conduction of plots and further analysis and to match the variable in the Kaggle data.  
The same transformation is made for the <b>fbs</b> variable.  
The <b>cigs</b> variables has been converted to a binary variable called <b>smoke</b>. If the patient has been smoking one or more cigarettes a day the smoke value is 1 else 0.</p>

<p>
The <b>num</b> variable in the raw data described with values from 0 to 4 different stages of angiographic disease status. 0 mean lower than 50% diameter narrowing of any of the three arteries: aorta, carotids and torso, that we have in our bodies. 1, 2, 3 and 4 means that there is more than 50% narrowing of any of these 3 main arteries which is classified as the patient is suffering from cardiovascular disease. So this variable is made binary. The value 1 covers the 4 stages of artery narrowing, while 0 means there is no presence of cardiovascular disease. This variable has been renames to <b>cvdPresent</b>.   
The resting blood pressure, also called the diastolic blood pressure, <b>trestbps</b> is measured in mm Hg. This can range from 60 to 90 or higher. By looking at the distribution of this variable, we see that there is multiple outliers.

<p>
Another way we can remove outliers is by calculating upper boundary and lower boundary by taking 3 standard deviation from the mean of the values (assuming the data is Normally/Gaussian distributed)
</p>


<h3>Kaggle data cleaning</h3>
<p>
The large Kaggle dataset contains information about cholesterol using discrete values between 1-3 determining normal, above normal and well above normal levels of serum cholesterol. To match this variable with the continuous serum cholesterol measurement column in the other datasets, the discrete <b>chol</b> column is modified. This is based on information from the Johns Hopkins medicine webpage [4](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/lipid-panel).
Normal level is defined as less than 200 mg/dl, above normal is ranging between 200 and 239 mg/dl and well above normal is a serum cholesterol level at or above 240 mg/dl. In R <b>chol</b> values has been replaces with normal distributed sample values in these ranges with maximum and minimum values possible to reach set to 400 and 0 based on visual exploration of data and outliers.  
</p>

<p>
Not only has variables been removed from data, but so is outliers from continuous variables. Removal of outliers for <b>trestbp</b> is done using standard deviation. The upper and lower boundaries of the measured resting blood pressure is found and data are remove if it's 3 or more standard deviations from the mean. (assume normal distribution of variable).  
</p>

<p>
The <b>height</b> and <b>weight</b> variable values has been kept if they were ranging between 119 and 211 cm and > 30 kg respectively.  
</p>

<p>
Outliers for <b>ap_hi<b> and <b>ap_lo<b> has been removed based on information from The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults [5](https://www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure/about.htm). Further the restriction of having a higher systolic than diastolic blood pressure is added for each subject.
